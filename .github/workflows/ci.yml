#
# CI Pipeline: Automated Pytest Execution for Math Operations Project
#
# This workflow runs all pytest test cases in the 'tests' directory on every push to 'main' and on pull requests targeting 'main'.
# It sets up Python 3.10, installs dependencies, executes tests, and fails if any test fails.
#
# --- Documentation ---
#
# 1. Triggers:
#    - Push to 'main' branch
#    - Pull request events targeting 'main' branch
#
# 2. Environment:
#    - Python 3.10
#    - Dependencies installed from requirements.txt (pytest)
#
# 3. Test Execution:
#    - All tests under 'tests/' are run via 'pytest'
#    - If any test fails, the workflow fails
#
# 4. Reporting:
#    - Pytest's output is shown in the GitHub Actions log
#    - For more detailed reporting, integrate with pytest plugins or GitHub Actions artifacts (see Recommendations)
#
# 5. Troubleshooting Guide:
#    - If the workflow fails:
#        * Expand the failed job in GitHub Actions UI to see logs
#        * Check for dependency installation errors
#        * Ensure 'requirements.txt' exists and includes 'pytest'
#        * Ensure the 'tests' directory and test files exist
#        * Review test failures for assertion errors or exceptions
#    - For environment-specific issues, check Python version compatibility
#
# 6. Recommendations for Optimization and Scalability:
#    - Cache pip dependencies to speed up builds (see commented 'actions/cache' section)
#    - Use matrix builds for multiple Python versions if needed
#    - Integrate code coverage (pytest-cov) and upload as an artifact
#    - Use status badges in README for workflow visibility
#    - For large test suites, consider parallel test execution
#    - For advanced reporting, use 'pytest-html' or upload JUnit XML artifacts
