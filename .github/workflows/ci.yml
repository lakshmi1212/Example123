# GitHub Actions CI Pipeline for Python (pytest)
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# This workflow automatically runs all pytest test cases in the
# 'tests' directory on every push or pull request to the main branch.
#
# Features:
# - Triggers on push and PR to 'main'
# - Sets up Python 3.10
# - Installs dependencies from requirements.txt (pytest)
# - Runs all tests in 'tests' directory
# - Fails pipeline if any test fails
# - Includes error handling, reporting, and documentation

name: CI Pipeline

description: |
  Production-ready CI pipeline for Python projects using pytest.
  Automatically runs all tests on push/PR to main branch with detailed error reporting.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Pytest Suite
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # 1. Checkout code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Python 3.10
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      # 3. Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; else pip install pytest; fi

      # 4. Run tests with pytest
      - name: Run pytest
        run: |
          pytest tests/ --maxfail=5 --disable-warnings --tb=short

      # 5. Upload pytest results (optional, for reporting)
      - name: Upload pytest results (if available)
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: pytest-results
          path: ./**/pytest*.xml
        continue-on-error: true

    # Error handling and reporting
    # - The job will fail if any test fails (pytest returns non-zero exit code)
    # - Test output will be available in the Actions UI
    # - Artifacts are uploaded for further inspection (if generated)

# Troubleshooting Guide
# ------------------------------------------------------
# - If the workflow fails at 'Install dependencies', ensure requirements.txt exists and is correct.
# - If tests are not discovered, check that the 'tests' directory and test files follow pytest naming conventions (test_*.py).
# - Review the Actions logs for detailed error messages.
# - For permission issues, ensure the workflow file is in the correct path and branch protections allow CI to run.
#
# Recommendations for Optimization & Scalability:
# - Use a build matrix for multiple Python versions if needed.
# - Cache dependencies for faster builds (actions/cache).
# - Integrate code coverage (pytest-cov) and upload coverage reports.
# - Add notifications (Slack, email) for failed builds.
