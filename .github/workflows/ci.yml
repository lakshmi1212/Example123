# Documentation:
# - This workflow runs on push and pull request events targeting the main branch.
# - Python 3.10 is set up on the runner.
# - Dependencies are installed from requirements.txt (pytest is required).
# - All tests in the tests/ directory are executed with pytest.
# - The workflow fails if any test fails (pytest non-zero exit code).
# - Pytest cache is uploaded as an artifact for debugging.
# - Inline troubleshooting guide is printed on failure.
#
# Recommendations for optimization and scalability:
# - For large test suites, consider splitting tests across multiple jobs or using matrix builds.
# - Integrate coverage reporting (e.g., with pytest-cov) for code quality metrics.
# - Use caching for dependencies to speed up workflow execution.
# - Add Slack or email notifications for failed builds.
