# CI Pipeline for Python project using pytest
# This workflow runs on push and pull requests to the main branch.
# It sets up Python 3.10, installs dependencies, runs tests, and fails on test errors.
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - If the workflow fails at 'Install dependencies', ensure requirements.txt exists and is valid.
# - If tests are not found, verify that the 'tests' directory exists and contains test_*.py files.
# - For Python import errors, check that 'src' is present and importable.
#
# OPTIMIZATION & SCALABILITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
# - Pin dependency versions in requirements.txt for reproducibility.
# - Add caching for pip dependencies to speed up builds.
# - Integrate code coverage reporting (e.g., with pytest-cov).
# - Use matrix builds for multiple Python versions if needed.
# - Add test result uploads as workflow artifacts for deeper analysis.
#
# VALIDATION REPORT:
# - This workflow is production-ready for Python 3.10 projects using pytest.
# - It fails the build on any test error and provides detailed output in GitHub Actions logs.
