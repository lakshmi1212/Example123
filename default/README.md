# Math Operations

This repository contains basic mathematical operations implemented in Python. Currently, it supports addition and subtraction.

## Usage

- The `src/math_operations.py` file contains the `add` and `subtract` functions.
- Test cases for these functions are located in the `tests` folder.

## Workflow

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the test cases using `pytest`.

### Example
```python
from src.math_operations import add, subtract

result1 = add(5, 3)  # Output: 8
result2 = subtract(5, 3)  # Output: 2
```
